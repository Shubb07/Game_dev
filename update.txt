Storyline 
Echoes in the Dark – A Short Narrative Horror Game
Tagline: “Some memories don’t stay buried. Especially the ones that aren’t yours.”
⭐ Act 1 – A Normal Night… Mostly

Arjun, a 19-year-old student, is home alone for the weekend.
Rain hits the rooftop. The house hums quietly.

He finishes a call with his mom:

Mom: “Make sure the windows are shut.
And don’t go into the basement. The lock is faulty.”

Simple objectives:
Lock the windows
Close the back door
Turn off unnecessary lights
But while walking, Arjun hears:

Footsteps upstairs (but no one is there)

A distant knock (but no one outside)

When he returns to his room, his desk chair is slightly moved.

A small discomfort begins.

⭐ Act 2 – First Disturbances

The power flickers.
The TV downstairs turns ON by itself — but it’s not static this time.

It shows a grainy security camera feed of…
Arjun’s house.
Live.

Rooms seen on the TV:

His hallway
His kitchen
His staircase
His bedroom door… slowly opening
But when he checks his room — nothing is changed.
On the TV table, he finds a note:

“Basement door wasn’t closed properly.”

He never went there.

New objective: Find the basement key.

When he grabs it, his phone gets a notification from an unknown number:

“Don’t go down there.”

Another message comes after 2 seconds:

“He’s awake.”

⭐ Act 3 – The Basement (First Jumpscare)

The basement is dim, damp, and full of boxes.
A light flickers violently.

As the player walks deeper:

A shadow sprints across the back of the basement (jumpscare moment)

Footsteps echo behind him

A chain rattles

At the far end, he finds:

Old family photos

One kid circled in red

Every face scratched — except Arjun’s

He turns around…
The basement door is now half-open, though he closed it.

A breathing sound grows louder behind him.

As he runs upstairs, the basement light turns pure red.

⭐ Act 4 – Hidden Truths

Upstairs, Arjun finds the house slightly rearranged:

A kitchen chair pulled out

A door he closed now open

A framed photo fallen on the ground

On the floor, another note:

“You shouldn’t live here.”

He checks his messages:

Mom hasn’t messaged

Dad hasn’t messaged

But a new unknown contact appears:

Unknown Contact:

“Check the attic.”

There is no attic door in this house normally.
But now…
A new pull-string door appears in the hallway ceiling.

⭐ Act 5 – The Attic & Major Plot Twist

Inside the attic:

Dust everywhere

Old toys

A single mattress

Chains near the window

A child’s journal

Inside the journal:

“I stayed here for months.
They never found me.”
“The boy who lives here now looks like me.”
“If I can’t have this house… no one can.”

Arjun realizes:

The person haunting the house isn’t a ghost.
It’s the missing tenant — a real intruder who lived in the walls.

And he’s still here.

⭐ Act 6 – THE CHASE SCENE

As soon as the player closes the journal:

A loud pounding begins from the attic walls.

Footsteps race above

A trapdoor slams open

The shadowy intruder crawls out at full speed

Cue chase sequence:

He chases Arjun through the hallway

Down the stairs

Into the kitchen

Into the living room

He knocks over objects while running

The screen shakes

Heavy breathing builds

Objective:
Reach Arjun’s bedroom and lock the door.

As the player slams the door shut…

Fists bang from the other side.

Then — silence.

⭐ Act 7 – The Final Twist

Arjun’s phone buzzes.
It’s his mom.

“We’re still five hours away.
Why did you open the back door?
It was locked when we left.”

The back door creaks slowly.

The intruder is now inside the house again.
Somewhere.

The lights go out.

Only the phone screen glows.

A final message appears from UNKNOWN:

“You locked the wrong door.”

A cold breath echoes behind Arjun.

A hand grabs his shoulder.

CUT TO BLACK.
